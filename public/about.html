        Who We Are
    </h2>

    <div class="textDiv">
        Akin to our group name, we found another thing in common, frustration with online
        organizers and planners. Between academic commitments, work obligations, and
        personal responsibilities, it was overwhelming to keep everything in order. That's
        when we came up with the idea of PlanZ - a solution designed to bring clarity
        and efficiency to your task management.
